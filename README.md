# Daily Planner
application is live at https://haydennease.github.io/daily-planner/

## Description 
This planner is used to save events to a given hour of the workweek. As the day progresses, the focus of the planner is updated to reflect the current time. Hours of the past are greyed out, the current hour is red, and hours in the future are green. Entering an event into the text box and hitting the save icon will commit that value to local storage. This allows for the user's entries to persist on page refresh or closure.
